# Sudoku-Webcam

Using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR libraries.

Personal project for solving Sudoku puzzles using images captured from a webcam in real-time 
and displaying the solution back to the user as an overlay over the puzzle.



Tested using a Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 (webcam)
Tested mainly on printed out sudoku puzzles from google images, 
and from http://www.websudoku.com/.
